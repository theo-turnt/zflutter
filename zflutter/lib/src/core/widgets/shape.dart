/// the [ZShape] widget to its enclosing [ZIllustration] must contain only
/// [ZWidget], [StatelessWidget]s or [StatefulWidget]s.
///
/// The [path] param will define the shape that will be drawn. You can customize
/// the appearance of the shape with [closed], [stroke], [fill], [color] and [visible]
///
/// If a [ZShape] widget is relative to a [ZPositioned], the path will be transform
/// accordingly to provide a new path that simulates a 3D view of the shape.
///
/// It is possible to add a different color for the back face of the shape with
/// [backfaceColor]. You can redefine what is the front and back of a shape by
/// changing the [front] vector.
///
/// If no path is provided a dot will be painted with the stroke as diameter.
